The Swisscom Application Cloud recognizes an app as Node.js by the existence of a `package.json` file in the root directory. For your own apps, you can create one by running `npm init --yes`.
The demo app you deployed already has a `package.json`, and it looks something like this:

```JSON
{
  "name": "cf-sample-app-node",

  ...

  "dependencies": {
    ...
  },

  ...

  "engines": {
    "node": ...
  },
}
```

The `package.json` file determines both the version of Node.js that will be used to run your application on <%= vars.product_short %>, as well as the dependencies that should be installed with your application. When an app is deployed, <%= vars.product_short %> reads this file and installs the appropriate node version together with the dependencies using the `npm install` command.

Run this command in your local directory to install the dependencies, preparing your system for running the app locally:

<pre class="terminal">
$ npm install
cf-sample-app-node@0.0.0 /.../cf-sample-app-node
├─┬ body-parser@1.15.0
│ ├── bytes@2.2.0
│ ├── content-type@1.0.1

...
</pre>

Once dependencies are installed, you will be ready to run your app locally.

  <a href="./run-locally.html" class="btn-primary">I've installed the App dependencies locally</a>
</div>
